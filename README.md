Backup of the classic `globe` command-line program originally written in 1994 by Jef Poskanzer.

'globe` prints an ASCII rendering of the sunlit side of the Earth at the current moment.  
This version was originally distributed through Homebrew as `globe 0.0.20140814`  
but has since been **disabled and removed** (Dec 6, 2024).

This repository preserves:
- The working executable binary (`globe`)
- The original 1994 README (`README.txt`)
- License: BSD-2-Clause

This allows the program to be restored and used on any Mac in the future, even though the upstream project and Homebrew formula are gone.
